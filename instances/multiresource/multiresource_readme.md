# MultiResource

MultiResource is a MultiMC utility designed to make it simple to share resource folders between Minecraft installs.

It automatically makes all MultiMC instances share resourcepacks, shaderpacks, and screenshots. Specfic installs can also be easily configured to share their saves and config folders as well.

# Setup

MultiResource is simple to set up, only taking a few steps:

1. Extract MultiResource to your MultiMC folder.

2. Enable developer mode in Windows Settings if you haven't. *This is required for MultiResource to create symbolic links, which are needed for it to function.*

3. Double click `setup_multiresource.bat` in your instances folder to run the setup script. *(You can also read over the batch script itself by right clicking and selecting Edit.)*

# Tools

MultiResource comes with a handful of useful tools to make managing the utility much easier.

These are listed in the sections down below.

## Options Editor

The Options Editor is a purpose-built instance of Minecraft dedicated to editing the default options file.

Any changes made within the Options Editor will be used to generate the options file for newly set up instances.

There's also a version of the Options Editor that runs OptiFine, in case you need to change any default settings in OptiFine's default options file as well.

## Open Universal Resources

This launch option will directly open File Explorer to MultiResource's universal resources folder for easy access to add files like resourcepacks and worlds to the universal resources.

## Edit Custom Resources

This option will open the custom resources batch file in Notepad to allow you to add custom resources to the universal resources folder.

Instructions for doing so are in comments in the batch file.
